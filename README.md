# Autonomous Racer

A Python-based autonomous racing car project that uses computer vision and path planning for autonomous navigation. This project was developed for ECEN-631 at BYU and demonstrates real-time control of a racing vehicle using Intel RealSense camera data and Arduino-based control systems.

## Features

- **Computer Vision**: Real-time image processing using OpenCV and Intel RealSense cameras
- **Hardware Integration**: Arduino-based motor and steering control
- **Data Collection**: Comprehensive data logging and analysis tools
- **Real-time Control**: Low-latency control system for responsive vehicle operation

## Key Components

- `ECEnRacer.py` - Main control loop integrating camera, path planning, and vehicle control
- `RealSense.py` - Intel RealSense camera interface for RGB, depth, and IMU data
- `Arduino.py` - Serial communication with Arduino for motor and steering control
- `path_planner.py` - Path planning algorithms for autonomous navigation
- `segmentation/` - Computer vision algorithms for lane and obstacle detection

## Hardware Setup

- Intel RealSense camera for vision
- Arduino microcontroller for vehicle control
- RC car platform with servo steering and motor control
- Serial communication interface

## Usage

Run the main control system:
```bash
python3 src/ECEnRacer.py
```

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Main source code
- `segmentation/` - Computer vision modules
